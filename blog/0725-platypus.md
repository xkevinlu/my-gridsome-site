I've been thinking about how we present our best selves to appeal to others professionally, as both a job seeker and interviewer. 

When I graduated college looking for my first job, the conventional wisdom thrown around was to *check the boxes*. I would look at portfolios of "successful" designers and model my portfolio after theirs. I would research the companies and teams extensively, figure out what qualities they were looking for, and made it a point to demonstrate all of those competencies in my interviews.

As an interviewer, now I see a plethora of portfolios that check all the boxes listed. Carefully crafted case studies that demonstrate a thoughtful design thinking process, showcasing a range of interaction, visual, UX, research, and other design skills. *Check.* Now what about the boxes not listed?

**What makes you different?**

## The platypus is unique.

It possesses the beak of a duck, fur of an otter, tail of a beaver, lays eggs, venomous, and many other traits. 

This mix is so bizarre that initially scientists thought its very existence must have been a hoax. "It naturally excites the idea of some deceptive preparation by artificial means," English zoologist George Shaw wrote in 1799. He even cut the pelt with scissors in a vain attempt to try and find the stitches that attached the bill to the pelt.

Given it's unique amalgamation of traits, how should a platypus apply for a job?

Despite being a jack of many trades, it is certainly master of none. If the job required only the fastest swimmers, it wouldn't stand a chance against sailfish and swordfish. If it were a competition to be the most venomous, its going to lose out to the box jellyfish and many others. Worst yet, if you were to evaluate a platypus by its ability to sing like songbirds, it might even start to lose self-esteem and think it'll never find gainful employment.

Instead, imagine how a platypus might successfully pitch himself for a job:

Remember that the intersection of your skills is what makes you unique. Let your inner platypus shine, and don't judge your inner platypus by its ability to sing a song.
